# White Noise

A set of experiments in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) for Axiom of Choice "white noise" art installation.

[curves.pde](curves.pde) is the main Processing project.

Source images are in [source_images](source_images) - but the original artwork by Alberto Glia is [source_images/mlk_layers.jpg](source_images/mlk_layers.jpg)

Code has some comments and is barebones for now.
