# White Noise

A set of experiments in [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) for [Axiom of Choice](http://axiomofchoice.network/) "white noise" art installation (WIP)

[curves.pde](curves.pde) is the main Processing project.

Source images are in [source_images](source_images) - but the original artwork by Alberto Glia is [source_images/mlk_layers.jpg](source_images/mlk_layers.jpg)

Code has some comments and is barebones for now.
Feel free to augment.

The origins of the project is an attempt to symbolize "information" within images via sinewave representations, here used metaphorically (and nothing to do with the actual information content of the image in a Fourier sense, or otherwise).
